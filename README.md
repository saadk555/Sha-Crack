Python_SHA1_Password_Cracker

This project is just a demonstrations of a password_cracking or passwords vulnerability assessment program, made with minimum amount of code in python which is pretty easy to understand for anyone.
initiallly made as a project for freecodecamp but now with few more functions

This still uses SHA-1 and that's because my purpose was to create an easy to understant project which would help cybersecurity learners to learn about security tools.


It might be getting more updates in future
