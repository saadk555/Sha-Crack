Password_Cracker

This is project is just a demonstrations of a password_cracking or password vulnerability assessment, made with  small code which would, Hopefully, be easy to understand for anyone.
initiallly made as a project for freecodecamp but now with few with more functions

This still uses SHA-1 and that's because my purpose was to create a easy to understant project which would help cybersecurity learners to learn about security tools.


In future, it might get updated with more functions.
